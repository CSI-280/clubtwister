# clubtwister
This is a project created by team Club Twister for our Open Source Software Development class, CSI-280.

The purpose of our site is to advertise animals like merchandise under the guise of getting them adopted
Its three main features are:
1. Display a list of pets available for adoption
2. Create a profile
3. Be able to add certain pets to a pet wishlist

Instructions for how to set up and run our website on a local machine are as follows:
1. Have a web browser such as Google Chrome installed on your device
2. Download files from github, whether through zip file or by cloning
3. Locate the file labeled "home" on your local computer and open it with a web broswer
4. This should get you to the website and allow access to all features of the site

This site uses the petfinder API to provide a list of animals and some function associated with displaying them to a website.
