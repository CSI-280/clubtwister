# Club Twister
This is a project created by team Club Twister for our Open Source Software Development class, CSI-280.

This is the third time I have attempted to add something to the readme.

Our team members are Lenora Batcher, Jacob Buzzell, Jasmine Carr, Jared Remsberg, and Steven Pershyn.

The purpose of our site is to advertise animals like merchandise under the guise of getting them adopted
Its three main features are:
1. Display a list of pets available for adoption depending upon species
2. Be able to search for animals that are a certain color or other factors
3. Be able to display the information about one particular pet

The species that the user can search for include dogs, cats, rabbits, and more. The results can be narrowed down by age,size, gender, color, etc. When the user clicks on a pet more information including a description of the animal will be shown.

Instructions for how to set up and run our website on a local machine are as follows:
1. Have a web browser such as Google Chrome installed on your device
2. Download files from github, whether through zip file or by cloning
3. Locate the file labeled "home" on your local computer and open it with a web broswer
4. This should get you to the website and allow access to all features of the site

This site uses the petfinder API to provide a list of animals with helpful attributes for searching and displaying them back to the user.  By using the petfinder API, we will be able to obtain pet objects with ID that can be added to a wishlist and retrieved at a later time.
