This is a project created by team Club Twister for our Open Source Software Development class, CSI-280.

It uses the Petfinder API. This is good because it collects pictures of dogs. I am adding more text now because I misread the assignment and merged the PR myself.
The purpose of our site is to __________, and it's three main features are:
1.
2.
3.

Instructions for how to set up and run our website on a local machine are as follows:
1. Have a web browser such as Google Chrome installed on your device
2. Download files from github, whether through zip file or by cloning
3. Locate the file labeled "home" on your local computer and open it with a web broswer
4. This should get you to the website and allow access to all features of the site
